The search for highly conducting $\ce{Li+}$ solid electrolytes focuses on sulfide- and halide-based materials, where typically the strongly atomic disordered materials are the most promising. The atomic disorder corresponds to a flattened energy landscape having similar relative site energies for different $\ce{Li+}$ positions facilitating motion. In addition, the highly disordered $\ce{Li+}$ conductors have a negligible defect formation energy as moving charges are readily available. 

This work investigates the isovalent $\ce{Li3Sb_{1-x}P_xS4 (0 \leq x \leq 0.5)}$ and the aliovalent $\ce{Li3+Sb_{1-x}P_xS4 (0 \leq x \leq 0.2)}$ substitution series of thio-LISICON materials by using X-ray diffraction, high-resolution neutron diffraction, impedance spectroscopy, and defect calculations. The starting composition $\ce{Li3SbS4}$ has a low ionic conductivity of $\sim 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{S \cdot cm^{-1}}$, and both substituents improve the ionic conductivity strongly by up to four orders of magnitude. 

On the one hand, in substituted $\ce{Li3SbS4}$ structures, only minor structural changes are observed which cannot sufficiently explain the significant impact on the $\ce{Li+}$ conductivity. On the other hand, the $\ce{Li+}$ carrier density reveals a correlation to the activation energy, and first-principles defect calculations display a significantly reduced defect formation energy upon substitution. Here, we show within two different substitution series that the defect formation energy plays a major role in ionic motion in this class of thio-LISICON materials.



Na-ion batteries are promising devices for smart grids and electric vehicles due to the cost effectiveness arising from the overall abundance of sodium (Na) and its even geographical distribution. Among other factors, the energy density of Na-ion batteries is limited by the cathode electrode chemistry. NaSICON- based electrode materials are known for their wide range of electrochemical potentials, high ionic conductivity, and most importantly their structural and thermal stabilities. Using first-principles calculations, we chart the chemical space of 3d transition metal-based NaSICON phosphates with the formula Na<sub>x</sub>MM<sup>'</sup>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (with M and M<sup>'</sup> = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) to analyze their thermodynamic stabilities and the intercalation voltages for $\ce{Na+}$ ions. Specifically, we compute the Na insertion voltages and related properties of 28 distinct NaSICON compositions. We investigate the thermodynamic stability of Na-intercalation in previously unreported $\ce{Na_xMn_2(PO_4)_3}$ and $\ce{Na_xVCo(PO_4)_3}$. The calculated quaternary phase diagrams of the Na–P–O–Co and Na–P–O–Ni chemical systems explain the origin of the suspected instability of Ni and Co-based NaSICON compositions. From our analysis, we are also able to rationalize anomalies in previously reported experimental data in this diverse and important chemical space.
