The search for highly conducting $\ce{Li+}$ solid electrolytes focuses on sulfide- and halide-based materials, where typically the strongly atomic disordered materials are the most promising. The atomic disorder corresponds to a flattened energy landscape having similar relative site energies for different $\ce{Li+}$ positions facilitating motion. In addition, the highly disordered $\ce{Li+}$ conductors have a negligible defect formation energy as moving charges are readily available. 

This work investigates the isovalent $\ce{Li3Sb_{1-x}P_xS4 (0 \leq x \leq 0.5)}$ and the aliovalent $\ce{Li3+Sb_{1-x}P_xS4 (0 \leq x \leq 0.2)}$ substitution series of thio-LISICON materials by using X-ray diffraction, high-resolution neutron diffraction, impedance spectroscopy, and defect calculations. The starting composition $\ce{Li3SbS4}$ has a low ionic conductivity of $\sim 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{S \cdot cm^{-1}}$, and both substituents improve the ionic conductivity strongly by up to four orders of magnitude. 

On the one hand, in substituted $\ce{Li3SbS4}$ structures, only minor structural changes are observed which cannot sufficiently explain the significant impact on the $\ce{Li+}$ conductivity. On the other hand, the $\ce{Li+}$ carrier density reveals a correlation to the activation energy, and first-principles defect calculations display a significantly reduced defect formation energy upon substitution. Here, we show within two different substitution series that the defect formation energy plays a major role in ionic motion in this class of thio-LISICON materials.
