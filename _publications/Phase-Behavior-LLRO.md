Li-rich layered transition metal oxides (Li<sub>1+x</sub>M<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or mLi<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>–nLiMO<sub>2</sub>) have been widely studied as cathode materials for Li-ion batteries recently due to their enhanced capacity of larger than 250 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>. 
However, even the qualitative nature of the phase stability of these materials, whether they form a solid solution or are phase separated, has been the subject of intense debate. 
In this work, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate the phase stability of these Li-rich layered transition metal oxides (Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>–LiMO<sub>2</sub>, M = Co, Ni, Mn). 
We calculate the mixing enthalpy and coherency strain energy between Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> and LiMO<sub>2</sub> for two distinct cases: (1) mixing of M on the Li and Mn sites respectively in the transition metal layer of Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>, resulting in 
a solid solution with <em>C2/m</em> symmetry, and (2) mixing of Li and Mn on the M sites of LiMO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a solid solution with <em>R~$\overline{3}$~m</em> symmetry. We show that phase separation is energetically preferred relative to a solid solution at 
T = 0 K, and the coherency strain energy has little influence on phase stability. Results also display that a solid solution with <em>R$\hat{3}$m</em> symmetry has a larger mixing enthalpy than that with <em>C2/m</em> symmetry at T = 0 K. Furthermore, 
we use the mixing enthalpies along with mean-field mixing entropies to calculate free energies and phase diagrams. At low temperature, the system exhibits phase separation between the <em>C2/m</em> and <em>R$\hat{3}$m</em> phases, with appreciable solubility in each phase,
and at high temperature, there is a transformation to the single-phase <em>R$\hat{3}$m</em> solid solution. For high Li content compositions, the phase diagram shows a region of stability for the single phase <em>C2/m</em> solid solution. 
Our calculations support one possible explanation for the discrepancies between various reports of the structure of these Li-rich layered materials; the compositions and temperatures of these synthesized materials 
could be close to phase boundaries separating the regions of solid solution vs phase-separation. The calculated phase diagrams also indicate that the phase stability of Li-rich layered materials largely depends on the synthesis 
temperature, the amount of excess Li, and the combination of transition metals.
