I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn).
I got Ph.D. in materials science and engineering at [National Univesity of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/mse/).

I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school here at 
UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas 
Nagel and Derek Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a 
combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with Mark D’Esposito 
at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center.

Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director of UCSF Bioethics and a 
member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
Neuroethics Working Group of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research 
through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working Group, the 
American Academy of Neurology’s Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee, and the Board 
of Directors of the International Neuroethics Society. I am also a research mentor in 
the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Career Development Program for Maximizing 
Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC) Scholars 
(K99/R00) from diverse backgrounds.
