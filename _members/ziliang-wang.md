I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn).
I got Ph.D. in materials science and engineering at [National Univesity of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/mse/).
Additionally I was awarded as [Associate Member of the Royal Society of Chemistry (AMRSC)](https://www.rsc.org) starting from 2025.

During 2019 to 2023, I focused on rechargeable alkali-ion batteries by multiscale computational methods under the supervision of Asst. Prof. [Pieremanuele Canepa](https://caneparesearch.org/team/Piero-Canepa/). Since 2023, I have been working as a postdoctoral research fellow at Northwestern University with Prof. [Chris Wolverton](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/wolverton-chris.html), funded by Ford Motor Company (Main Technical PI: [Andy Drews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-drews-7370a67/)). In general, I work on energy storage and conversion technologies, combining conventional high-throughput computationals and modern physics-informed machine-learning techniques, in order to accelerate discovery and optimization of novel energy materials and advance the computational materials science.
