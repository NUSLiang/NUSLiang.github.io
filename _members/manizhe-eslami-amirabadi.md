Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and altered as needed.
My interest in the body as a 'depository of human expressiveness’ led me to a degree
in Psychomotor Therapy with a Master’s specialization in old age and mental health
(University of Lisbon). My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with
specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris),
provided me with the basis for understanding brain aging mechanisms.

Brain function was one of the most fascinating parts of medicine for me and while
training in neurology, I realized that I am especially interested in cognitive
function including language and behavior. Ethical aspects of dementia as a disease
and observation of its burden on the patients and their caregivers have been also
an important motivation for me to pursue further training and research efforts in
the field of neuroethics with hopes to help providing a more equitable care around
the world by raising awareness about current disparities and gaps in health literacy
and healthcare access.

I love poetry, literature and music. They help me enjoy and make sense of our complex
world. I spend my spare time with them, friends, family, or nature! I also love art
museums!
