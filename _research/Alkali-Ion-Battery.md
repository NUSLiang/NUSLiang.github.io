In the critical area of energy storage technologies, rechargeable alkali-ion batteries (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) have been proved to be the promising alternative to conventional energy resources, due to their potential safety, energy-density, and cycle-life benefits. As a crucial role in green-energy economy, rechargeable batteries have attracted considerable attentions worldwide.
Lithium (Li)-ion battery is one of the most developed and commercialized rechargeable battery technologies, since it has been introduced to the public in [1976](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.192.4244.1126). After J. B. Goodenough invented the [lithium cobalt oxide cathode](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025540880900124?via%3Dihub) in 1980, a large variety of cathode (and anode) materials have been discovered for Li-ion batteries, with steady race to reach higher energy densities, safety, cycle life, etc. 

We actively work to advance the development of novel monovalent (Li and Na) multivalent ion (Mg, Zn and Ca) batteries by leveraging advanced computational materials science. We study the dynamic of multivalent-ion during stripping and deposition at the anode electrodes, the intercalation processes in high-voltage positive materials by unveiling complex features in their compositional phase diagrams. Our research also focuses on identified the bottlenecks of multivalent transport in these electrodes.
