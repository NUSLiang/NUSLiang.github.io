In the critical area of energy storage technologies, rechargeable alkali-ion batteries (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) have been proved to be the promising alternative to conventional energy resources, due to their potential safety, energy-density, and cycle-life benefits. As a crucial role in green-energy economy, rechargeable batteries have attracted considerable attentions and supported a variety of electronic devices ranging from portable smart phones to sizeable electrical vehicles.
Lithium (Li)-ion battery is one of the most developed and commercialized rechargeable battery technologies, since it has been introduced to the public in [1976](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.192.4244.1126). After J. B. Goodenough invented the [lithium cobalt oxide cathode](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025540880900124?via%3Dihub) in 1980, a large amount of cathode (and anode) materials have been discovered for Li-ion batteries, with steady race to reach higher energy densities, safety, cycle life, etc. Moreover, post-Li-ion batteries, such as Na-ion batteries, have also been actively studied recently to reach higher energy densities and better safety beyond Li-ion batteries.

Combining first-principles calculations and experimental characterizations/engineerings, we actively work to discover and optimize battery components (i.e., cathode, anode, electrolyte, the corresponding interfaces, as well as all-solid-state batteries) to boost the development of battery materials science. We study thermodynamic properties, such as stabilities of various phases, phase transformations, cycling voltages, etc, as well as kinetic performance, such as alkali-ion diffusivities, migration tendencies, etc.
