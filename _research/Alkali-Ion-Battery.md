Rechargeable alkali-ion batteries (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) have been proved to be the promising alternative to conventional energy resources, due to their potential safety, energy-density, and cycle-life benefits. As a crucial role in green-energy economy, rechargeable batteries have attracted considerable attentions and supported a variety of electronic devices ranging from portable smart phones to sizeable electrical vehicles.
Li-ion battery is one of the most developed and commercialized rechargeable battery technologies, since it has been introduced to the public in [1976](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.192.4244.1126). After J. B. Goodenough invented [lithium cobalt oxide cathode](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025540880900124?via%3Dihub) in 1980 for Li-ion battery, a large amount of electrode/electrolyte materials have been discovered, among which, cathode factors prominently in the overall energy density of a battery.

Moreover, batteries beyond Li-ion metrics have also been actively studied, such as Na-ion, Ca-ion and Mg-ion batteries. Notably, all-solid-state battery frameworks have also been proposed and investigated recently.

Combining first-principles calculations and experimental characterizations/engineerings, we work to discover and optimize battery components (i.e., cathode, anode, electrolyte, the corresponding interfaces, as well as all-solid-state batteries) to boost the development of battery materials science. We study thermodynamic properties, such as stabilities of various phases, phase transformations, cycling voltages, etc, as well as kinetic performance, such as alkali-ion diffusivities, migration tendencies, etc. We also construct machine-learning database for battery materiasl.
