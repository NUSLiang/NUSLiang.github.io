In the critical area of energy storage technologies, solid-state batteries (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential safety, energy-density, and cycle-life benefits. Lithium (Li)-ion battery is one of the most developed and commercialized rechargeable battery technologies, since it has been introduced to the public in [1976](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.192.4244.1126). After J. B. Goodenough invented the [lithium cobalt oxide cathode](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025540880900124?via%3Dihub) in 1980, a large variety of cathode (and anode) materials have been discovered for Li-ion batteries, with steady race to reach higher energy densities, safety, cycle life, etc.
