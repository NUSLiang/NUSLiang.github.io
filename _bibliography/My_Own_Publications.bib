              Na-ion batteries are promising devices for smart grids and electric vehicles due to the cost effectiveness arising from the overall abundance of sodium (Na) and its even geographical distribution. Among other factors, the energy density of Na-ion batteries is limited by the cathode electrode chemistry. NaSICON-based electrode materials are known for their wide range of electrochemical potentials, high ionic conductivity, and most importantly their structural and thermal stabilities. Using first-principles calculations, we chart the chemical space of 3d transition metal-based NaSICON phosphates with the formula Na
              x
