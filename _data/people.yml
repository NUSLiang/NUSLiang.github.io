  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one 
               another. I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical 
               practice focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
               and other cognitive disorders of aging. I am also a **cognitive 
               neuroscientist**, applying observations from clinic to 
               investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad 
               decisions. Third, I am a **neuroethicist**, working alongside 
               other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to address the 
               ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
               to altered brain function. 
               
               
               I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During 
               medical school here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in 
               philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek 
               Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did 
               a combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging 
               with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
               at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the 
               [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director 
              of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              and a member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. 
              Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
              [Neuroethics Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through 
              Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working 
              Group, the American Academy of Neurology's 
              [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and the 
              [Board of Directors](https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/board){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the International Neuroethics Society. I am also a research 
              mentor in the Association of American Medical Colleges' Career 
              Development Program for 
              [Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC)](https://www.aamc.org/about-us/mission-areas/medical-research/mosaic-scholars){:target="\_blank"} 
              Scholars (K99/R00) from diverse backgrounds.

  description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and 
                altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make 
                us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use 
                in space and time. 
                My interest in the body as a 'depository of human 
                expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a 
                Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University 
                of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population 
                triggered my interest in old age, 
                and I realized how much I still had to learn about the 
                biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the 
                disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
                My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with 
                specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie 
                Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for 
                understanding brain aging mechanisms. 
                My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in 
                Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain 
                Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative 
                diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible 
                therapeutic approach. 
                As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to 
                the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s 
                language abilities are affected during a disease process is 
                another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its 
                consequences on one’s identity.


                I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to 
                aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of 
                altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early 
                cognitive and functional decline. 
                By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am 
                excited to explore how the process of decision-making is 
                affected and which are the neural basis that subtends 
                decision-making alterations.
