    I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
    I am a <strong>behavioral neurologist</strong>, and my clinical practice focuses on
    Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of aging.
    I am also a <strong>cognitive neuroscientist</strong>, applying observations from clinic
    to investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad decisions.
    Third, I am a <strong>neuroethicist</strong>, working alongside other clinicians,
    researchers, and policymakers to address the ethical and social implication
    of changes in decision-making due to altered brain function.

    I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school here at 
    UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas 
    Nagel and Derek Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a 
    combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with Mark D’Esposito 
    at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center.

    Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director of UCSF Bioethics and a 
    member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Beyond UCSF, I serve on the
    through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working Group, the 
    American Academy of Neurology’s Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee, and the Board 
    of Directors of the International Neuroethics Society. I am also a research mentor in 
    the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Career Development Program for Maximizing 
    Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC) Scholars 
    (K99/R00) from diverse backgrounds.
