    I obtained my bachelar at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    I got Ph.D. at National Univesity of Singapore.

    I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school here at 
    UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas 
    Nagel and Derek Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a 
    combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with Mark D’Esposito 
    at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center.

    Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director of UCSF Bioethics and a 
    member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
    Neuroethics Working Group of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research 
    through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working Group, the 
    American Academy of Neurology’s Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee, and the Board 
    of Directors of the International Neuroethics Society. I am also a research mentor in 
    the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Career Development Program for Maximizing 
    Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC) Scholars 
    (K99/R00) from diverse backgrounds.

    Having lived for extended periods in Thailand, Japan, and the United States,
    I gained insight into the diverse healthcare practices and attitudes toward 
    dementia and the disparate resources for diagnosis, treatment and care
    across borders and demographic groups. I want to use my background in 
    health economics and the expertise I acquire at UCSF Memory and Aging
    Center to contribute to the advancement of brain health equity through
    enhanced public health programs that can provide global benefits.
    <br>

    I earned my PhD in Health Economics from Hiroshima University and a master’s
    degree in Human Resource Development from Waseda University in Tokyo. My 
    doctoral research in Dr. Yoshihiko Kadoya’s lab focused on identifying key
    determinants that exposed populations in different countries to increased
    health risks thereby enabling timely intervention measures.

    Joining Decision Lab under Dr. Winston Chiong is an exciting opportunity.
    I am currently working on a project aimed at understanding how genetic 
    predispositions to frontotemporal dementia influence decision-making in 
    the pre-symptomatic phase. Through neuroeconomic methods, the research 
    seeks to identify incidents of early impaired judgment that could lead 
    to intervention strategies to decelerate the onset of frontotemporal 
    dementia.

    Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and altered as needed.
    My interest in the body as a 'depository of human expressiveness’ led me to a degree
    in Psychomotor Therapy with a Master’s specialization in old age and mental health
    (University of Lisbon). My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with
    specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris),
    provided me with the basis for understanding brain aging mechanisms.

    Brain function was one of the most fascinating parts of medicine for me and while
    training in neurology, I realized that I am especially interested in cognitive
    function including language and behavior. Ethical aspects of dementia as a disease
    and observation of its burden on the patients and their caregivers have been also
    an important motivation for me to pursue further training and research efforts in
    the field of neuroethics with hopes to help providing a more equitable care around
    the world by raising awareness about current disparities and gaps in health literacy
    and healthcare access.

    I love poetry, literature and music. They help me enjoy and make sense of our complex
    world. I spend my spare time with them, friends, family, or nature! I also love art
    museums!
